# Cyberlab Roadmap

Planning document for taking this repository from its current state to a
self-contained, classroom-deployable cyber range appliance.

**Written:** 2026-08-04
**Analyzed at commit:** `5dd0092`
**Target:** own classroom pilot spring 2027, appliance design by summer 2027
**Not on the critical path:** this supplements the Cyber.org curriculum.
Nothing here blocks teaching this year.

## Product definition

**Cyberlab is a lab-in-a-box:** a small cluster of quiet, low-power compute
nodes in a rolling rack that a school district can deploy into a classroom and
run a cyber range on, with no dependence on district network services.

Two delivery paths:

| SKU | What ships | Licensing position |
|---|---|---|
| **Recipe** | Public BOM, install automation, documentation | You distribute no software — no GPL/AGPL obligation attaches |
| **Prebuilt** | Assembled, imaged, tested hardware | You distribute Proxmox — source-offer and trademark obligations apply |

**Design principle that makes this work:** the prebuilt units must be
reproducible from the public recipe. If the box a district buys is exactly the
free recipe applied to hardware, then GPL/AGPL compliance is close to
automatic — the source offer is satisfied by the recipe itself — and your value
is assembly, testing, warranty, and support rather than software lock-in. That
is an honest model to sell to schools, and it is much easier to defend than a
proprietary fork.

### Licensing obligations for the prebuilt SKU

- Provide or offer complete corresponding source for AGPL/GPL components. A
  written offer valid three years is the conventional mechanism; Proxmox
  publishes its source.
- **Do not modify Proxmox.** Notably, the common "remove the subscription nag"
  patch is a modification and would trigger publication obligations.
- Do not call the product Proxmox or imply endorsement. "Built on Proxmox VE"
  is fine.
- Your own control plane and playbooks are **not** infected. Code calling `qm`
  across an API boundary is a separate work; GPL explicitly permits mere
  aggregation.

## Constraints

| Constraint | Value | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment | Classroom appliance, rolling rack | Noise, power, and thermal are product requirements |
| Topology | 3-5 refurb mini/SFF PCs | ~32-64 GB RAM per node; density matters; no shared storage |
| Connectivity | **Assume none** | Everything preloaded; zero downloads at deploy or run time |
| Peak concurrency | 16-30 students | Drives the RAM budget and therefore the BOM |
| VM allocation | On-demand pods | Created at lab start, destroyed at lab end |
| Student hardware | Any browser | No client install, no VPN, no local hypervisor |
| Remote access | Opt-in module, **off by default** | Shipped units self-contained; your own box enables the tunnel |
| Licensing | FOSS, reproducible from public recipe | See product definition above |

## Current state

Summer work (`c44bdfd`…`5dd0092`) closed the largest gaps from the first
analysis:

- **The validation gate now exists.** `controller-validate-template-clone.yml`
  clones a promoted template, boots it, waits on the QEMU guest agent,
  discovers a non-loopback IPv4, pings it, and cleans up.
- **One template catalog.** `data/templates.yml` removed;
  `ansible/vars/templates.yml` is authoritative.
- **Dead code removed** — `template_env.py` (which held a guaranteed
  `NameError`), `build-imported-templates.sh`, `create-installer-template-vms.sh`.
- **Testing and recovery docs** added.

### Still open

1. **`automation_token_secret` is never assigned.** `host-bootstrap.yml:263`
   asserts on it, `:603` writes it to the controller env file, but commit
   `4539d5d` deleted the `set_fact` that extracted it from `pveum` output.
   Fresh installs fail. Recoverable from `45f13a9`.
2. **Automation user gets no privileges.** No `pveum acl modify` ever runs, so
   the token has zero permissions. `controller-validate-proxmox-api.yml` passes
   regardless, because `/version` is readable by any authenticated user — a
   false green.
3. **`install-cyberlab.sh:281`** uses `#{ROTATE_API_TOKEN}` instead of `${...}`.
4. **`generate_runtime_artifacts.py:89`** calls `raiseValueError`.

### Structural gaps

- **Per-section VNets are never created.** Only `prov0` exists.
- **No egress control** on classroom networks.
- **No CI.** `--syntax-check` and `bash -n` both pass on everything, so
  parse-level checks would not have caught any of the four defects above.
- **OpenTofu files still empty** — see decision below.

## Architecture

### Factory versus site — the defining split

**A shipped appliance cannot build its own templates.** The pipeline currently
downloads Debian cloud images, `apt-get install`s from Debian repos, adds the
OpenTofu apt repo, and pulls LXC templates via `pveam`. Commit `5dd0092` added
`prov0` egress specifically so template builds could reach the internet.

With no connectivity assumed, the system splits in two:

| | Factory (your bench, online) | Site (classroom, offline) |
|---|---|---|
| Template download and build | Yes | Never |
| Validation gate | Yes | Never |
| Package installation | Yes, baked into images | Never |
| Pod clone / start / stop / destroy | For testing | Yes |
| Guacamole connection provisioning | For testing | Yes |

This is good news: the entire template factory — the most fragile part of the
system — becomes your problem rather than a district sysadmin's. The appliance
only needs to clone from images already present.

**Work this implies:**

- `bootstrap-controller.sh` currently runs `apt-get update`/`install` and adds
  the OpenTofu apt repo. That becomes a factory step baked into the controller
  LXC image.
- `host-bootstrap.yml` runs `pveam download`. Factory step.
- Templates must be replicated to every node's local storage, because linked
  clones require the template on the same storage as the clone.
- **Time.** Offline means no NTP. Clock drift breaks TLS validation, Guacamole
  tokens, and Proxmox corosync membership. Designate one node as the cluster
  time source.
- **DNS.** No upstream resolver. Ship a local one for lab names.
- **Certificates.** Guacamole over HTTPS on an offline box has no public CA
  path. Either ship an internal CA and accept the distribution problem, or
  serve plain HTTP on an isolated network and document the tradeoff.
- **Updates.** Districts need new labs and patches somehow. Design a signed
  offline bundle applied from USB.

### Cluster topology

Three to five mini/SFF nodes, local NVMe on each, no shared storage.

- **Proxmox cluster needs three nodes for quorum.** Three is the floor.
- **No Ceph.** It wants more RAM and more nodes than this hardware has. Local
  ZFS or LVM-thin per node, with templates replicated to each.
- **Pod affinity: all VMs of a pod land on one node.** This lets pod networks
  use node-local SDN zones instead of VXLAN spanning nodes — dramatically less
  to break offline, and no inter-node traffic for pod-internal packets. The
  scheduler picks the least-loaded node with room for the whole pod.
- **No HA.** A node failure kills the pods on it; students restart. Acceptable
  for a classroom lab, and HA on refurb hardware is a support burden with no
  educational payoff.

### RAM budget — this drives the BOM

Full VMs, lean sizing, roughly 6 GB per 3-VM pod:

| Nodes × RAM | Usable after host overhead | Concurrent students at 6 GB/pod |
|---|---|---|
| 3 × 64 GB = 192 GB | ~180 GB | ~20 (tight at 30) |
| 4 × 64 GB = 256 GB | ~240 GB | ~30 with headroom |
| 5 × 64 GB = 320 GB | ~300 GB | ~40 |

**Four nodes at 64 GB is the recommended starting point** for a 30-student
target. Three nodes is a fine 16-20 student pilot and the minimum for quorum.

Note that the current `slots.yml` values are far too generous for this
hardware — `atk` alone is 4 vCPU / 8 GB, which would be 240 GB at 30
concurrent. Right-sizing is mandatory, not optional.

### Density: use Proxmox LXC, not a second hypervisor

Earlier analysis raised container density as an argument for a hypervisor
abstraction with an Incus backend. **That was the wrong conclusion — Proxmox
runs LXC containers natively, alongside VMs.** The density win is available
without changing hypervisors at all.

A container-based pod runs roughly 1-1.5 GB instead of 6 GB. On a 3-node
cluster that is the difference between ~20 concurrent students and 100+.

Containers cannot run Windows, and cannot host labs needing custom kernels or
kernel exploitation. So the model is mixed:

- **VMs** for Windows targets, privilege escalation, kernel-level work
- **LXC** for networking, recon, web application, and log analysis labs

Start with VMs — they work for everything. Add LXC as a density optimization
once specific labs prove they don't need full virtualization.

### Hypervisor abstraction: build discipline, not an interface

With density available inside Proxmox and AGPL manageable through the
reproducible-from-recipe principle, the case for a formal `HypervisorDriver`
interface is much weaker than it looked. An appliance means you control the
whole stack and standardize on one backend; shipping two doubles your support
burden for zero district benefit.

**Recommendation: the middle path.**

- Proxmox-specific calls confined to one Ansible role or one Python module
- VMIDs never appear in `data/` or in the control-plane schema — they live in
  an allocation table the Proxmox layer owns
- The pod engine's vocabulary is templates, pods, networks, and addresses, not
  `qm` flags

This keeps a future backend swap as a bounded refactor rather than
archaeology, at a fraction of the cost of building the abstraction now.

### Identifiers

The encoded scheme `vmid = teacher_id * 1000000 + section_code * 1000 + offset`
was designed for a single-teacher deployment. Its ceiling — 999 teachers, 999
sections, 999 VMs — is **not** a problem for a per-school appliance, so the
scalability argument for replacing it has largely evaporated.

What remains is flexibility: organizational facts change (teachers move,
sections get co-taught), VMIDs are Proxmox-specific, and a fixed assignment
leaves most of the space empty while fighting on-demand allocation. Also,
`policy.yml` reserves offsets 100-199 for students — 20 students at 5 slots —
while `icsa1` has 24 and `itsb3` has 30, already overflowing.

**Downgraded to "worth doing when convenient."** Keep human readability in VM
names and Proxmox tags; move VMIDs to a pool allocator when the pod engine is
built anyway.

### Access control

Proxmox's per-student user/pool/ACL model is retired. It cannot express
"three concurrent pods," "expires in ninety minutes," or "only during third
block."

| Layer | Component | License | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| Identity | Keycloak or Authentik | Apache 2.0 / MIT | Who is this person |
| Authorization | **Control plane (ours)** | Ours | Policy and quotas |
| Connection broker | Apache Guacamole | Apache 2.0 | Which consoles are reachable now |
| Hypervisor | Proxmox VE | AGPLv3 | Runs workloads; one service account |

`pod up` provisions Guacamole connections through its REST API; `pod down`
removes them. A student sees only what the control plane created for them.

Retire for students: `proxmox-users.yml`, `proxmox-pools.yml`,
`proxmox-acls.yml`, `proxmox-pool-membership.yml`. Keep Proxmox RBAC for the
teacher/admin account only.

For a fully offline box, consider whether a separate identity provider earns
its complexity — Guacamole's own database auth may be sufficient at
single-classroom scale, with an IdP added only if districts require SSO.

### Provisioning tool

The four `.tf` files are empty, which is fortunate. OpenTofu is poor for
resources created and destroyed many times a day per user. Provision pods from
the control plane directly. Reserve OpenTofu for durable infrastructure or drop
it. If any IaC ships: **OpenTofu (MPL 2.0), never Terraform (BUSL 1.1, not open
source).**

### Content licensing

| Image | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Debian 13 | Permissive | Keep — base and primary target |
| Parrot OS | GPL-based, redistributable with compliance | For the prebuilt SKU, prefer a slim self-built Debian toolbox |
| **Windows 7** | **Non-redistributable, out of support** | **Remove.** `ansible/vars/templates.yml:142` points at an archive.org ISO — untenable in anything sold |
| Metasploitable2 | Redistribution terms ambiguous | Replace with **Metasploitable3 (BSD-3-Clause)** |
| — | — | Add **OWASP Juice Shop (MIT)** |

Both problem images are `enabled: false` today, so there is no urgency — but
neither can ship in a prebuilt unit.

## Open design question: how do student devices reach the box?

This is unresolved and it materially changes the BOM and the district
conversation.

**Model A — box joins the classroom LAN.** District assigns it an IP; students
browse to it from school devices. Simple hardware, but requires district
network approval and an IP allocation, and puts the appliance on their LAN.

**Model B — box brings its own network.** Include a switch and/or access point
in the BOM; student devices connect directly to the lab network. Truly plug
into power and go, and it **sidesteps district network approval almost
entirely** — a significant product advantage.

**The catch with Model B:** district-managed Chromebooks are frequently locked
to the district network, forced through a proxy, or unable to join arbitrary
Wi-Fi. That may make Model B unusable with exactly the student devices the
product targets.

This needs a real answer from a district sysadmin before the BOM is finalized.

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Stabilize (Aug 2026)

Fix the four surviving defects. Add root `.gitignore` (`scripts/__pycache__/`
is untracked), `ansible.cfg`, `requirements.yml`.

**Exit:** two consecutive clean `install-cyberlab.sh` runs on a wiped host;
API token demonstrably performs a privileged action.

### Phase 1 — CI (Sep 2026)

`yamllint`, `ansible-lint`, `shellcheck`, `pytest`. Checks for undefined
variables and playbooks targeting hosts absent from inventory — both classes
of defect exist in the repo today.

**Exit:** CI green; reintroducing any Phase 0 defect turns it red.

### Phase 2 — Factory template pipeline (Oct 2026)

Debian 13 green through prepare → finalize → promote → validate. Add Juice
Shop and Metasploitable3. **Formalize the factory/site split** — mark every
task that requires internet and move it behind a factory-only flag.

**Exit:** a deliberately broken image fails validation; a documented image set
is producible offline from a bench build.

### Phase 3 — Hardware and BOM (Oct-Nov 2026)

Acquire and validate the cluster. Measure real per-VM RAM. Verify noise under
load in a room, power draw on a single classroom circuit, and thermals in a
closed rack. Resolve the student-network question above. Publish BOM v1.

**Exit:** a running 3-node cluster you have measured, not estimated.

### Phase 4 — Pod provisioning engine (Nov-Dec 2026)

`pod up`, `pod down`, `pod reset`. Node scheduler with pod affinity. Linked
clones under 60 seconds. Idle reaper. Right-sized slot definitions and
`data/labs.yml` scenarios.

### Phase 5 — Network isolation (Dec 2026)

Create per-section and per-pod VNets. No egress from lab networks — not the
internet, not the district LAN, not the Proxmox management network. Prove
isolation with a test that runs on every deploy. Prove DHCPDISCOVER receives
DHCPOFFER.

### Phase 6 — Access layer (Jan 2027)

Guacamole LXC, connection provisioning tied to pod lifecycle, session
recording, idle timeout. **Remote access tunnel as an opt-in module, disabled
by default** — `cloudflared` outbound-only, zero inbound ports, Cloudflare
Access in front. Enabled on your own box; shipped off.

### Phase 7 — Appliance packaging (Feb-Mar 2027)

Reproducible image build. Offline update bundle, signed, applied from USB.
First-boot configuration for a district sysadmin. Recovery procedure. The
documentation a stranger needs to run this without you.

### Phase 8 — Pilot (Mar-Apr 2027)

Your own classroom, one section, one scenario. Then a friendly district.
Instrument everything; fix; repeat. Map labs onto the Cyber.org units they
supplement.

## Immediate next actions

1. Resolve the student-network question with a district sysadmin — it gates
   the BOM
2. Fix the four Phase 0 defects
3. Stand up CI
4. Price a 3-node and 4-node cluster; verify the refurb supply is repeatable
   enough to publish as a BOM
